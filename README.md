# Notepad App

## Description
In this challenge I used express to GET, POST, and DELETE json data to a notepad app. I created routes to the homepage and notes api so the app has multiple views. When the user saves a note it will POST the json data to the database. The user can DELETE a note and it will destroy the json data from the database.

## Usage
Users can view previeous notes they have saved, create new notes that will be saved to a database, or delete existing notes which will destroy that notes data from the database.
